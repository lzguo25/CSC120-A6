- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


- I think inheritance feels a lot more intuitive than I had expected it to be. I think that it makes things a lot more convenient. Inheritance makes the code a lot more organized and easy-to-read, which made the rest of the assignment and code be a lot more efficient. This assignment definitely felt easier since the parent class was already given and we didn't have to write it on our own. I found the library and hashtable to be a little confusing, but after learning a little more Java syntax, I was able to complete the assignment. For someone taking this class in the future I definitely advise that they are confident with knowing the concept of parent and child class, and understand how the child can inherit attributes and definitions while also having it's own.
